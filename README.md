# Zero Editor
The web node-based Zero editor.


## What is this?
This is a web node-based editor that aims to provide a modern solution to [PAC3](https://github.com/CapsAdmin/pac3).
Zero's concept is very simple, provide a blueprint like editor and have said editor compile your schemes to actual pac3 outfits.


## Why?
- I needed a project on my freetime.
- Many people have requested such a change over the years.
- Because PAC3 in my humble opinion needs to be overhauled.


## Why Zero?
The name "Zero" is a reference to PAC3's versioning that are already a joke among pac users, for instance a category of PAC3 is called "PAC4".
So the name that came was originally PAC0 and then just Zero.
